The report is organized as follows: In section 2, we introduce the dataset we use briefly data preprocessing steps.In section 3, we discussed how to use weighted non-negative matrix factoration to predict missing data and methods to evaluate the results. In section 4, we discussed the weighted non-negative matrix factorization with regularization parameters and how to implement it with the alternating least squares algorithm. And we repeat the evaluation methods to compare results with the previous parts. In section 5, we evaluated the recommendation system with the precision when recommending top 5 movies. Moreover, by changing the number of movies to recommend, we plot the curve between hit rate and false alarm rate.
